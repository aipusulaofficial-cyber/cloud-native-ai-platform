# Cloud-Native AI Platform

**Principal-level reference implementation** focused on cloud-native service boundaries, health-aware operation, deployment safety, and infrastructure portability.

## Engineering intent
- Clear domain boundaries and replaceable infrastructure adapters
- Explicit contracts, validation, and failure semantics
- Deterministic tests with external dependencies isolated
- Operational readiness through health checks, CI, and security validation
- Architecture decisions documented so trade-offs are reviewable

## System design
The repository is structured around explicit responsibilities rather than framework-driven coupling. Domain policy, orchestration, infrastructure adapters, and operational concerns remain separable so components can evolve independently.

## Quality bar
- **Correctness:** contract, edge-case, and failure-path tests
- **Reliability:** bounded work, explicit failure behavior, and health signals where applicable
- **Security:** least-privilege boundaries, input validation, and safe defaults
- **Observability:** correlation/context propagation and actionable operational signals
- **Delivery:** reproducible CI validation before changes are considered complete

## Principal engineering contract
See [docs/PRINCIPAL-ENGINEERING.md](docs/PRINCIPAL-ENGINEERING.md) for the reviewable engineering contract, NFRs, and change-safety checklist.

## Architecture & decisions
See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and the ADRs directory for system boundaries, key trade-offs, and extension points.

## Engineering principle
The goal is to make important behavior **explicit, testable, observable, auditable, and replaceable** without adding complexity that does not buy a measurable engineering property.
